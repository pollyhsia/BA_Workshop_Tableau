## Project Outline and Tableau Summary

### Part 1

This story has used the dataset Young People Survey from Kaggle which explores the preferences, interests, habits, opinions and fears of youngsters. The original survey was presented to the young between 15 and 30 by both electronic and written forms, and 1010 pieces of information were collected.

The reason why we choose this domain is that we are exactly young people. The questions and answers in the questionnaires resonate with ourselves. Since the dataset reflects every aspect of the young, we can have a panorama of ourselves through visualizing it, regardless of the differences of demographics.
